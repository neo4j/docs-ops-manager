= Server installation
:description: This section provides details on server installation.

Server installation is a two-step process.
The first step, as described in the previous section, is to setup a Neo4j DBMS to act as persistence for NOM.

The second step is to download and configure arguments and/or environment variables to the specific environment you want to run NOM in and either install NOM as a service or run it as a console application.
Both ways are described below.
Running as a service is the recommended way of operating the NOM Server.

Releases of Neo4j enterprise all come bundled with the most current version of NOM at the time of that Neo4j release. 
Please note that this does not have to be the most current version of NOM.
You can find NOM as `.zip` or `.tar.gz` inside your Neo4j folder under `/products`.
Alternatively, you can download any version of the NOM Server, including the agent binaries here: https://neo4j.com/download-center/#ops-manager[Download].
In any case, please extract the content from the downloaded `.zip` or `.tar.gz` file to whichever directory you want to operate NOM from
(in the following referenced as NOM server-folder).

// [[server-package]]
// == Server package: Client, server, and APIs

== Prerequisites

* Windows or unix-based operating system
* Java 17
* Key pair and certificate (as a PKCS12 file) to be used for TLS protected endpoints (see xref:installation/self-signed-certificate.adoc[] for test and demo purposes).

[IMPORTANT]
====
In case you have multiple versions of Java installed on the machine you will use for the server, you can set `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to the desired Java home directory.
====

[[service]]
== Running as a service

=== Linux (systemd)
==== Setting arguments in service file

Navigate to the NOM server-folder under `etc/` where a `neo4j-ops-manager-server.service` file is located.
This file includes a section that needs to be adjusted to your environment (e.g. the Neo4j password you used for setting up the persistence database, the proper path to your ssl key-store file, etc.).

==== Using environment variables

As an alternative to changing the arguments in the `neo4j-ops-manager-server.service` file, you can instead use environment variables to achieve the same result.
The `neo4j-ops-manager-server.service` file contains the necessary information for this.
The table <<config_ref,here>> contains environment variables and example values. 

==== Installation

After updating the `neo4j-ops-manager-server.service` file to reflect your configuration, it must be copied into the directory `/etc/systemd/system`.

Next, execute the following commands to install the NOM Server as a service:

[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable neo4j-ops-manager-server
----

==== Starting and stopping

Once the installation is successfully completed, you can start the NOM Server as a service with the command:

[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
sudo systemctl start neo4j-ops-manager-server
----

The NOM Server is now ready to use.

To stop the NOM Server, use the command:

[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
sudo systemctl stop neo4j-ops-manager-server
----


=== Windows
==== Setting arguments in the service file

Navigate to the NOM server-folder under `bin\`, where a `service.xml` is located.
This file includes an `<arguments>` section that needs to be adjusted to your environment (e.g. the Neo4j password you used for setting up the persistence database, the proper path to your SSL key-store file, etc.).

==== Using environment variables

As an alternative to changing the arguments in the `service.xml` file, you can instead use environment variables to achieve the same result.
The `service.xml` file contains the necessary information for this.
The table <<config_ref,here>> contains environment variables and example values.

==== Installation

You install the server service using `server.exe`, provided in the NOM server folder under `bin\` by running the following command:

[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
server.exe install
----

==== Starting and stopping

Once the installation is successfully completed, you can start the NOM Server as a service with the command:

[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
server.exe start
----

The NOM Server is now ready to use.

To stop the NOM Server, use the command:

[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
server.exe stop
----

== Running as a console application

[WARNING]
====
Although it is possible to run the NOM Server as a console application, it is not recommended.
Best practice is to run the NOM Server as a service, as described in the previous section.
====

=== Unix
==== Passing arguments on command line

Navigate to the NOM Server folder and execute the following command:

[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
java -jar ./lib/server.jar
        --spring.neo4j.uri=neo4j://localhost:7687
        --spring.neo4j.authentication.username=neo4j
        --spring.neo4j.authentication.password=password
        --server.port=8080
        --server.ssl.key-store-type=PKCS12
        --server.ssl.key-store=file:./certificates/server.pfx
        --server.ssl.key-store-password=changeit
        --grpc.server.port=9090
        --grpc.server.security.key-store-type=PKCS12
        --grpc.server.security.key-store=file:./certificates/server.pfx
        --grpc.server.security.key-store-password=changeit
        --jwt.secret=please-set-a-random-secret-string-here-for-jwt-signing
----

Make sure to replace the arguments with values adjusted to your environment (e.g. the Neo4j password you used for setting up the persistence database, the proper path to your ssl key-store file, etc.).

==== Using environment variables

All of the arguments from the command in the last section can also be defined as environment variables as described <<config_ref, here>>.

If you set all the arguments to environment variables, you can shorten the server start command to the following (provided that you have navigated to the NOM Server folder):

[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
java -jar ./lib/server.jar
----

=== Windows
==== Passing arguments on the command line

Navigate to the NOM Server folder and execute the following command:

[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
java -jar .\lib\server.jar
        --spring.neo4j.uri=neo4j://localhost:7687
        --spring.neo4j.authentication.username=neo4j
        --spring.neo4j.authentication.password=password
        --server.port=8080
        --server.ssl.key-store-type=PKCS12
        --server.ssl.key-store=file:.\certificates\server.pfx
        --server.ssl.key-store-password=changeit
        --grpc.server.port=9090
        --grpc.server.security.key-store-type=PKCS12
        --grpc.server.security.key-store=file:.\certificates\server.pfx
        --grpc.server.security.key-store-password=changeit
        --jwt.secret=please-set-a-random-secret-string-here-for-jwt-signing
