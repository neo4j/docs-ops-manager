:description: This section describes the Home Page of the Neo4j Ops Manager.

Once running, Ops Manager can, by default, be accessed by navigating to the following location:

----
http(s)://<server>:8080
----

Replace `server` with the hostname of the machine running Ops Manager Server.
If Ops Manager is running on the computer you are reading this on, try `http://localhost:8080`.

The default username is `admin` and the default password is `passw0rd`.
To change the password from the user interface, click the top right settings icon that redirects you to the global settings.
Then click *Settings* on the left side where you can find a form to change the password.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure to always store passwords safely.
Losing passwords leads to getting locked out of the system.
