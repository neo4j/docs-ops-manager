:description: This section describes the upgrade process from an earlier version of NOM.
= Upgrading from an earlier version

It is recommended to always keep NOM up-to-date with the latest available version.
You can update from any older NOM version to any newer version.
A version downgrade is not possible.
The natural order of NOM versions follows the *xref:../appendix/version-compatibility.adoc#versioning_scheme[semantic versioning scheme]*.

[[server]]
== Upgrading server

[NOTE]
====
Before starting the update process, it is recommended to back up your existing NOM installation folder.

[[server-version-notes]]
== Version specific notes

=== 1.4

The initial startup of 1.4 after update may take longer than usual, especially if the persistence store contains a large amount of query log data.

This is due to additions to the query log model which require existing data to be migrated.

=== 1.3
[IMPORTANT]
====

All metrics will be deleted as part of the migration that runs on update to version 1.3.

This is due to a major change to the metric storage model making previous metrics incompatible with this version.
