= Neo4j instance requirements

In order to be managed by NOM, a Neo4j instance **must** be running a Neo4j Enterprise Edition v4.4.2 or higher (including all 5.x versions).

== Query log collection

[NOTE]
====
Log manager is only compatible with Neo4j version 5+.
====

For the query log collection feature to work correctly, these configuration settings need to be set in the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/configuration/neo4j-conf/[neo4j.conf] file:

** `db.logs.query.enabled` is set to `INFO` or `VERBOSE`.
** `db.logs.query.threshold` is unset (is defaults to `0`) or set to a reasonable value.
This setting acts as the execution time lower bound for any completed query to appear in the logs.
Thus, if this value is set too high, the queries you want to monitor might not get logged.
Setting this value to zero will log every query.
** `db.logs.query.annotation_data_format` is unset or set to `CYPHER` (which is the default value).
Other formats will result in partially or completely missing query log entries in NOM.
** `db.logs.query.annotation_data_as_json_enabled` is unset or set to `false` (which is the default value).
`true` will result in partially or completely missing query log entries in NOM.

== Metrics collection

For the metrics collection feature to work correctly, these configuration settings need to be set in the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/configuration/neo4j-conf/[neo4j.conf] file:

=== For 4.4.x versions:

** `metrics.prometheus.endpoint=127.0.0.1:2004`

** `metrics.prometheus.enabled=true`

** `metrics.enabled=true`

** `metrics.filter=*`

** `metrics.jmx.enabled=true`

** `metrics.namespaces.enabled=true`

=== For 5.x versions:

** `server.metrics.prometheus.endpoint=127.0.0.1:2004`

** `server.metrics.prometheus.enabled=true`

** `server.metrics.enabled=true`

** `server.metrics.filter=*`

** `server.metrics.jmx.enabled=true`

== User privileges

The agent logs on to the DBMS with the configured user to enable certain features such as viewing relationship and label types, managing privileges, and viewing configuration values.
If you do not want to use the built-in admin user, a role with the minimum set of privileges required for full functionality can be created with:

[NOTE]
====
This role definition can not be used for the user with which the Ops Manager server connects to the persistence database since it has insufficient privileges.
This `operator` role should only be used for the DBMS you want to monitor with an agent.
