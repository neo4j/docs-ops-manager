= Neo4j instance requirements

In order to be managed by NOM, a Neo4j instance **must**:

* be running a Neo4j Enterprise Edition v4.4.0 or higher (including all 5.x versions).

== Query log collection

[NOTE]
====
Log manager is only compatible with Neo4j version 5+.
====

For the query log collection feature to work correctly, `db.logs.query.enabled` needs to be set to `INFO` or `VERBOSE` in the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/configuration/neo4j-conf/[neo4j.conf] file.
Also, make sure that the config value `db.logs.query.threshold` is set to a reasonable value, `0`, commented out or is removed. 
This setting acts as an lower bound for any completed query to appear in the logs. 
Thus, if this value is set too high, the queries you want to monitor might not get logged. 
Setting this value to zero will log every query.

[[server_log_config]]
=== Finding out the location of server log configuration (server-logs.xml)

The location of server log configuration file is configured in `neo4j.conf` (see documentation on link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/configuration/configuration-settings/#config_server.logs.config[Operations Manual -> server.logs.config] configuration setting).

The currently effective location of server log configuration can be found out using the following Cypher query:

[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
./cypher-shell "CALL dbms.listConfig() YIELD name, value WHERE name='server.logs.config' RETURN value"
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure that the server log configuration exists, otherwise NOM agent will not be able to add query log collection configuration to it.
====

== Metrics collection

For the metrics collection feature to work correctly. these configuration values need to be set in the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/configuration/neo4j-conf/[neo4j.conf] file.:

=== For 4.4.x versions:

** `metrics.prometheus.endpoint=127.0.0.1:2004`

** `metrics.prometheus.enabled=true`

** `metrics.enabled=true`

** `metrics.filter=*`

** `metrics.jmx.enabled=true`

** `metrics.namespaces.enabled=true`

=== For 5.x versions:

** `server.metrics.prometheus.endpoint=127.0.0.1:2004`

** `server.metrics.prometheus.enabled=true`

** `server.metrics.enabled=true`

** `server.metrics.filter=*`

** `server.metrics.jmx.enabled=true`

== User privileges

The agent logs on to the DBMS with the configured user to enable certain features such as viewing relationship and label types, managing privileges, and viewing configuration values.
If you do not want to use the built-in admin user, a role with the minimum set of privileges required for full functionality can be created with:

[NOTE]
====
This role definition can not be used for the user with which the Ops Manager server connects to the persistence database since it has insufficient privileges.
This `operator` role should only be used for the DBMS you want to monitor with an agent.
====

[source, cypher]
----
CREATE ROLE `operator`;

GRANT ACCESS ON DATABASE * TO `operator`;
GRANT MATCH {*} ON GRAPH * NODE * TO `operator`;
GRANT MATCH {*} ON GRAPH * RELATIONSHIP * TO `operator`;
GRANT SHOW CONSTRAINT ON DATABASE * TO `operator`;
GRANT SHOW INDEX ON DATABASE * TO `operator`;

GRANT EXECUTE PROCEDURE * ON DBMS TO `operator`;
GRANT EXECUTE ADMIN PROCEDURES ON DBMS TO `operator`;
GRANT SHOW SERVERS ON DBMS TO `operator`;

// Required for security manager:
GRANT USER MANAGEMENT ON DBMS TO `operator`;
GRANT ROLE MANAGEMENT ON DBMS TO `operator`;
GRANT PRIVILEGE MANAGEMENT ON DBMS TO `operator`;
