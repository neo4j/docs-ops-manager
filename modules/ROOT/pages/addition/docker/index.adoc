:description: describes the process of monitoring a Neo4j Docker container with NOM agent.

Apart from monitoring Neo4j instances running on a host or a virtual machine, an agent can be setup to monitor containerized Neo4j instances.

This section lists some of the methods to set up agents to monitor containerized Neo4j instances in standalone and Docker compose deployments.
For Kubernetes deployments of Neo4j instances, see xref:addition/kubernetes/index.adoc[this section] for more information.
