= Manually registered agent
:description: this page describes the manual registration, installtion, configuration and running of NOM agents to monitor a Neo4j instance.

[[register]]
== Register agent

Before installing an agent, it needs to be registered with the NOM server to provide server communication configuration.

. Click the top right settings icon that redirects you to the global settings.
+
image::agents-settings-icon.png[width=800]
+
. Click *Agents*, where you will see a list of all registered agents along with their last contact times and versions.
+
image::agents.png[width=800]
+
. Click *Register New Agent* button, and enter the name and description for your new agent followed by clicking *Register* button.
+
image:agent-new.png[width=800]
+
. The agent will be created and randomly generated agent credentials will be displayed on the screen.
+
image:agent-credentials.png[width=800]
+
[NOTE]
====
The credentials and other key agent configuration values are displayed as environment variable declarations.
You can copy them over to the host for ease of agent configuration.
====
+
. After you have captured the credentials, click the confirmation checkbox and *Finish* button.
Newly created agent will be displayed on the list of agents.

[[install]]
== Install agent

The following steps are required to install an agent:

* Standalone binaries (only linux and windows platform binaries are available)
** Download: https://neo4j.com/download-center/#ops-manager[Download]

NOTE: If downloading agents is not a option in some environments, NOM agents are also bundled into Neo4j packages which can be used for the installation as described xref:./install-packaged.adoc[here]

** Extract the archive

** This step is only required if using *SELinux*.
To permanently change the SELinux context of the agent binary, run the following commands:
+
[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
sudo semanage fcontext -a -t bin_t <EXTRACTED_DIRECTORY_PATH>/bin/agent
sudo restorecon -v <EXTRACTED_DIRECTORY_PATH>/bin/agent
----
+
<EXTRACTED_DIRECTORY_PATH> should be replaced with the path to the extracted directory.


** Add the `bin` folder in the extracted directory to `PATH`

** To verify the installation, run the following command:
+
[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
agent version
----
+
Which should output:
+
[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
<agent name> <agent version> <agent revision>
----

* Make sure the agent version is equal to that of the NOM server.

[[configure]]
== Configure agent

An agentâ€™s run configurations are provided through environment variables.
The tables here list configuration keys and values to be set for them.

The following environment variables need to be set to allow the agent to communicate with the NOM Server.
Copy these from the `Agent Credentials` dialog in the register step.

NOTE: For a self registering agent, token configuration below is not a requirement as specified xref:./self-registered.adoc#configure[here].

[cols="<,<,<",options="header"]
|===
| Variable
| Description
| Example

| `CONFIG_SERVER_ADDRESS`
| Server GRPC Address
| server:9090

| `CONFIG_TOKEN_URL`
| Server Token URL
| +++https://server:8080/api/login/agent+++

| `CONFIG_TOKEN_CLIENT_ID`
| Client ID for the agent
|` 3ff98478-d6d2-4e1b-b816-e758c835f076`

| `CONFIG_TOKEN_CLIENT_SECRET`
| Client secret for the agent
| secret
|===

The following environment variables specify start configuration for the agent:
[cols="<,<,<",options="header"]
|===
| Variable
| Description
| Example
| `CONFIG_TLS_TRUSTED_CERTS`
| PEM encoded trusted CA list ()
| `/path/to/a/pem/file`

| `CONFIG_LOG_LEVEL`
| Log level (debug,info,warn,error)
| info

| `CONFIG_LOG_FILE`
| Path to the log file
| `/var/log/nom-agent/log.txt`
|===

[NOTE]
====
Since agent-server communication needs to be encrypted, you need to configure the agent so that it trusts the server's certificates.
The file that contains the trusted certificate list (PEM encoded) can be specified through the `CONFIG_TLS_TRUSTED_CERTS` environment variable.
While most operating systems default to the system-wide trusted certificates, that's not the case on Windows.
For that reason, you **must** set this environment variable on Windows.
====

For each managed DBMS instance on the host, the following environment variables need to be set to allow the agent to access the instance:

[cols="<,<,<",options="header"]
|===
| Variable
| Description
| Example

| `CONFIG_INSTANCE_n_NAME`
| Name of nth instance
| my-instance-n

| `CONFIG_INSTANCE_n_BOLT_URI`
| Bolt URI for nth instance with bolt or bolt+s protocol
| bolt://localhost:7687 or bolt+s://localhost:7687 or bolt+ssc://localhost:7687, depending on the local database setup

| `CONFIG_INSTANCE_n_BOLT_USERNAME`
| Bolt user name for nth instance
| neo4j

| `CONFIG_INSTANCE_n_BOLT_PASSWORD`
| Bolt password for nth instance
| password
|===

[[querylog]]
To enable the query log collection functionality, there are also a few additional environment variables.
If `CONFIG_INSTANCE_n_QUERY_LOG_PORT` is not set, the feature is treated as disabled. 
The rest of NOM still works.

[cols="<,<,<",options="header"]
|===
| Variable
| Description
| Example

| `CONFIG_INSTANCE_n_QUERY_LOG_PORT`
| Port for connecting the agent to the Neo4j log4j appender
| 9500

| `CONFIG_INSTANCE_n_LOG_CONFIG_PATH`
| Path to the instance <<server_log_config,log4j config file>>.
If set, appends the appropriate log appender automatically (including the port specified above).
| /var/lib/neo4j/conf/server-logs.xml

| `CONFIG_INSTANCE_n_QUERY_LOG_MIN_DURATION`
| Minimum duration in milliseconds for a query to be logged (optional)
| 100

| `CONFIG_INSTANCE_n_QUERY_LOG_MIN_DURATION_FILTER_ERRORS`
| Enable filter for errors under the minimum duration in milliseconds (optional)
| true

| `CONFIG_INSTANCE_n_QUERY_LOG_DISABLE_OBFUSCATION`
| Disable the string literal obfuscation in queries (optional)
| true

| `CONFIG_INSTANCE_n_QUERY_LOG_INCLUDE_AGENT`
| Collect and show queries coming from the NOM agent (optional)
| true
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
Environment variable considerations:

* `n` in the above environment variables needs to be replaced with `1`, `2`, etc. for each of the monitored DBMS instances on the same host.
For example, for a single monitored DBMS, the environment variables must be named as `CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_NAME`, `CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_BOLT_URI`, `CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_BOLT_USERNAME` and `CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_BOLT_PASSWORD`.
* The instance name that you specify for `CONFIG_INSTANCE_n_NAME` will be used to identify your instance on NOM.
For this reason, it is important that you specify unique names across your cluster.
====

[NOTE]
====
Agents are supposed to monitor only local instances and should not be configured to connect to remote instances.
====

[NOTE]
====
Refer to *xref:../addition/../addition/instance-requirements.adoc[Neo4j instance requirements]* to ensure that all instances meet the requirements to be managed by NOM.
====

[[running-agent]]
== Run agent

An agent can run in two modes, console or service.
Best practice is to run an agent in service mode.

. Run an agent in console mode:
+
All configuration values for the agent should be set as environment variables before starting the agent
+
* Command:
+
[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
agent console
----

. Run an agent in service mode:
+
To run an agent in service means that the agent process runs in the background and monitors the instance and this is the recommended way.
The agent lifecycle is handled by the operating system service manager.
+
* Install the service for linux (systemd):
+
** Run
+
[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
agent service install
----
** Execute
+
[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
systemctl edit neo4j-ops-manager-agent.service
----
+
and set environment variables by either setting Environment or EnvironmentFile options.
For example, using the Environment options, the override file can look like this:
+
[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
[Service]
Environment="CONFIG_SERVER_ADDRESS=<server grpc address>"
Environment="CONFIG_TOKEN_URL=<server http login url>"
Environment="CONFIG_TOKEN_CLIENT_ID=<client id>"
Environment="CONFIG_TOKEN_CLIENT_SECRET=<client secret>"
Environment="CONFIG_TLS_TRUSTED_CERTS=</path/to/trusted/certs/pem/file>"
Environment="CONFIG_LOG_FILE=</path/to/nom-agent/log.txt>"
Environment="CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_NAME=<instance name>"
Environment="CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_BOLT_URI=<bolt uri of the local instance>"
Environment="CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_BOLT_USERNAME=<local instance user name>"
Environment="CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_BOLT_PASSWORD=<local instance password>"
Environment="CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_QUERY_LOG_PORT=<an available port>"
Environment="CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_LOG_CONFIG_PATH=<path to server-logs.xml>"
----
+
Please refer to the full list of options <<configure,here>>.

** Start your service
+
[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
systemctl start neo4j-ops-manager-agent.service
----
+
or
+
[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
systemctl stop neo4j-ops-manager-agent.service
----
** Logs are available, using journalctl, via
+
[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
journalctl -u neo4j-ops-manager-agent
----
+
* Install the service for Windows:
** Run
+
[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
agent service install
----
+
** Open registry editor and navigate to `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\neo4j-ops-manager-agent`.
** Create a key of type `REG_MULTI_SZ` named `Environment` and add your environment variables, each on a separate line, for example:
+
[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
CONFIG_SERVER_ADDRESS=<server grpc address>
CONFIG_TOKEN_URL=<server http login url>
CONFIG_TOKEN_CLIENT_ID=<client id>
CONFIG_TOKEN_CLIENT_SECRET=<client secret>
CONFIG_TLS_TRUSTED_CERTS=</path/to/the/trusted/certs/pem>
CONFIG_LOG_FILE=</path/to/nom-agent/log.txt>
CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_NAME=<instance name>
CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_BOLT_URI=<bolt uri of the local instance>
CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_BOLT_USERNAME=<local instance user name>
CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_BOLT_PASSWORD=<local instance password>
CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_QUERY_LOG_PORT=<an available port>
CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_LOG_CONFIG_PATH=<path to server-logs.xml>
----
+
Please refer to the full list of options <<configure,here>>.

** Start your service
+
[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
agent service start
----
+
* To uninstall the service
+
[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
agent service uninstall
----

[[server_log_config]]
=== Finding out the location of server log configuration (server-logs.xml)

The location of server log configuration file is configured in `neo4j.conf` (see documentation on link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/configuration/configuration-settings/#config_server.logs.config[server.logs.config] configuration setting).

The currently effective location of server log configuration can be found out using the following Cypher query:

[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
./cypher-shell "CALL dbms.listConfig() YIELD name, value WHERE name='server.logs.config' RETURN value"
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Check that the server log configuration exists, otherwise NOM agent would not be able to add query log collection configuration to it.
====

[[verify]]
== Verify agent setup
Ensure agent has contacted NOM server, is online and is reporting DBMS(s) correctly.

. Return to Agents listing in global settings
+
image::agents.png[width=800]
. Identify the newly created agent.
. Check that there is a value for _Last contact time_.
    ** If the agent has never contacted NOM server then go back to where the agent is running and check the logs.
    It may be that the server address is configured incorrectly or the TLS certificates are not correctly specified. 
. Verify that the agent has a current status of `Online`. 
    ** If the agent is not currently online then go to where it is running and check the logs.
. Hover over the newly added agent and click the cog icon to show agent configuration. Check configuration is as expected.
. Navigate to the home page (if this agent is the first to manage an instance in a DBMS, it may take a few minutes for the DBMS to appear).
. Select the _Alerts_ tab and make sure that there are no alerts for any of the DBMSs managed by the new agent.
