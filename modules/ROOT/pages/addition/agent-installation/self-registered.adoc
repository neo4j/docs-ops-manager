= Self-registering agent
:description: this page describes NOM agent self-registering setup.

Agent self-registration omits manually acquiring token information from NOM UI as described in xref:./manual.adoc#register[Manually registering agent].
Instead, minimal configuration of the NOM server is provided to allow the agent to connect and register itself.
Authorization is granted either through manual approval of the agent in the UI or through mutual authentication.

A self-registering agent is useful in an automated environment such as a Kubernetes cluster of Neo4j instances where instances are dynamically created and managed.

[[running-agent]]
== Run agent 
To run a self-registering agent, an additional command line option is provided as `-s` for short and `--self-register`.

== Running as a service

To run an agent in service mode means that the agent process runs in the background and monitors the instance.
The agent lifecycle is handled by the operating system service manager.
Best practice is to run an agent in service mode.

=== Linux (systemd)

==== Service installation

[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
agent service -s install
----
==== Setting arguments

Run the following to edit the service:

[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
systemctl edit neo4j-ops-manager-agent.service
----

Set environment variables by either setting Environment or EnvironmentFile options.
For example, using the Environment options, the override file can look like this:

[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
[Service]
Environment="CONFIG_SERVER_GRPC_ADDRESS=<server grpc address>"
Environment="CONFIG_SERVER_HTTP_ADDRESS=<server http address>"
Environment="CONFIG_TLS_TRUSTED_CERTS=</path/to/trusted/certs/pem/file>"
Environment="CONFIG_LOG_FILE=</path/to/nom-agent/log.txt>"
Environment="CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_NAME=<instance name>"
Environment="CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_BOLT_URI=<bolt uri of the local instance>"
Environment="CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_BOLT_USERNAME=<local instance user name>"
Environment="CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_BOLT_PASSWORD=<local instance password>"
Environment="CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_QUERY_LOG_PORT=<an available port>"
Environment="CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_LOG_CONFIG_PATH=<path to server-logs.xml>"
----

Please refer to the full list of options <<configuration,here>>.

==== Starting and stopping

To start the service: 
[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
systemctl start neo4j-ops-manager-agent.service
----

To stop the service:
[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
systemctl stop neo4j-ops-manager-agent.service
----

Logs are available, using journalctl, via

[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
journalctl -u neo4j-ops-manager-agent
----

=== Windows

==== Service installation

[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
agent service -s install
----

==== Setting arguments

* Open registry editor and navigate to `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\neo4j-ops-manager-agent`.
* Create a key of type `REG_MULTI_SZ` named `Environment` and add your environment variables, each on a separate line, for example:
+
[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
CONFIG_SERVER_GRPC_ADDRESS=<server grpc address>
CONFIG_SERVER_HTTP_ADDRESS=<server http address>
CONFIG_TLS_TRUSTED_CERTS=</path/to/the/trusted/certs/pem>
CONFIG_LOG_FILE=</path/to/nom-agent/log.txt>
CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_NAME=<instance name>
CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_BOLT_URI=<bolt uri of the local instance>
CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_BOLT_USERNAME=<local instance user name>
CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_BOLT_PASSWORD=<local instance password>
CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_QUERY_LOG_PORT=<an available port>
CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_LOG_CONFIG_PATH=<path to server-logs.xml>
----

Please refer to the full list of options <<configuration,here>>.

==== Starting and stopping

To start the service:

[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
agent service -s start
----

To uninstall the service:

[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
agent service -s uninstall
----

== Running as a console application

All <<configuration, configuration>> values for the agent should be set as environment variables before starting the agent.

[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
agent console -s

or

agent console --self-register
----

[[verify]]
== Verify agent setup
Ensure agent has contacted NOM server, is online and is reporting DBMS(s) correctly.

. Return to Agents listing in global settings.
+
image::agents.png[width=800]
. Find self-registered agent in list.
 ** If the agent is not in the list then go back to where the agent is running and check the logs.
    It may be that the server address is configured incorrectly or the TLS certificates are not correctly specified. 

. Approve agent if required.
** An agent in standby mode shows up in the list of agents in NOM UI with `Unauthorized` status. 
+
image::agent-unauthorized.png[width=800]
To enable the agent to continue its normal execution, the agent needs to be approved from the NOM UI as shown below:
.. Click on `...` agent action icon and click `Approve Agent`:
+
image::agent-action-menu.png[width=800]
.. Update agent name or description if desired and click 'Approve':
+
image::agent-approve.png[width=800]
.. Upon approval, the agent status changes to `Offline` until the agent receives token information and re-connects to NOM server.
+
image::agent-approved-offline.png[width=800]
.. Wait for agent status to change to `Online` indicating that the agent has successfully re-connected to the NOM server and is in normal execution mode. 
This can take a few minutes. 
+
image::agent-approved-online.png[width=800]
. If the agent status is not 'Online' then go to where it is running and check the logs.
. Hover over the newly added agent and select "View Configuration" from the menu on the right to show agent configuration. Check configuration is as expected.
. Navigate to the home page (if this agent is the first to manage an instance in a DBMS, it may take a few minutes for the DBMS to appear).
. Select the _Alerts_ tab and make sure that there are no alerts for any of the DBMSs managed by the new agent.


[[configuration]]
== Agent configuration reference

=== Registration configuration

[cols="<,<,<",options="header"]
|===
| Variable
| Description
| Example

| `CONFIG_SERVER_GRPC_ADDRESS`
| Server GRPC Address
| server:9090

| `CONFIG_SERVER_HTTP_ADDRESS`
| Server HTTP address (** should include protocol scheme **)
| +++https://server:8080+++

|`CONFIG_TLS_TRUSTED_CERTS`
| PEM encoded trusted CA list ()
| `/path/to/a/pem/file`
|===

[NOTE]
====
Since agent-server communication needs to be encrypted, you need to configure the agent so that it trusts the server's certificates.
The file that contains the trusted certificate list (PEM encoded) can be specified through the `CONFIG_TLS_TRUSTED_CERTS` environment variable.
While most operating systems default to the system-wide trusted certificates, it is not the case on Windows.
For this reason, you **must** set this environment variable on Windows.
====

The following optional configuration can be used to specify the location for  xref:./agent-config-file.adoc[agent config file]: 

[cols="<,<,<,<",options="header"]
|===
| Variable
| Description
| Example
| Default

| `CONFIG_AGENT_CONFIG_PATH`
| Persistent path to a file on Neo4j instance host
| "file://path/to/"
| `NEO4J_CONF` if set or `conf` folder under `NEO4J_HOME` if set, else `.nom` folder in user home directory.
|===

WARNING: Agent config location must be of persistent type. 

Agent meta-data can be optionally specified using these configuration parameters:

[[agent-meta-data]]
[cols="<,<,<",options="header"]
|===
| Variable
| Description
| Example

| `CONFIG_AGENT_NAME`
| Optional name for agent to easily differentiate among self-registered agents
| home-db-agent

| `CONFIG_AGENT_DESCRIPTION`
| Optional description for agent to easily differentiate among self-registered agents
| An agent to monitor home db
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
It's recommended to set agent name and description if multiple agents are being self-registered on similar hosts as it would lead to confusion with similarly named agents appearing in UI for approval.
====

[[agent_mtls]]
==== Additional configuration for mutual authentication (optional)

With only the above configuration, the agent will connect to NOM server, register itself and then enter *Standby mode*.

*Standby mode* is the runtime state of a self-registering agent which is not authorized yet to monitor instances. 
In this mode agent keeps checking with NOM server for approval status at every preset time interval (__default 30 seconds__).

The agent exits *Standby mode* once it has been manually approved in the UI. 

Mutual authentication eliminates the manual approval step. 
The NOM server immediately authorizes an agent that registers using a trusted certificate.

The following configuration is required to enable mutual authentication:

[cols="<,<,<",options="header"]
|===
| Variable
| Description
| Example

| `CONFIG_TLS_CLIENT_CERT`
| PEM encoded Agent certificate for mutual TLS
| `/path/to/a/pem/file`

| `CONFIG_TLS_CLIENT_KEY`
| PEM encoded Agent key for mutual TLS
| `/path/to/a/pem/file`
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
In addition to the above configuration, the NOM server also needs to be configured to trust the agent certificates as described xref:/installation/server.adoc#config_ref[here].
====

[NOTE]
====
Self-signed certificates for agents in test and demo environments can be generated as documented xref:./agent-self-signed-certificates.adoc[here].
====

===  Agent logging configuration

The following environment variables specify start configuration for the agent:
[cols="<,<,<",options="header"]
|===
| Variable
| Description
| Example

| `CONFIG_LOG_LEVEL`
| Log level (debug,info,warn,error)
| info

| `CONFIG_LOG_FILE`
| Path to the log file
| `/var/log/nom-agent/log.txt`
|===


=== Monitored instance configuration
For each managed DBMS instance on the host, the following environment variables need to be set to allow the agent to access the instance:

[cols="<,<,<",options="header"]
|===
| Variable
| Description
| Example

| `CONFIG_INSTANCE_n_NAME`
| Name of nth instance
| my-instance-n

| `CONFIG_INSTANCE_n_BOLT_URI`
| Bolt URI for nth instance with bolt or bolt+s protocol
| bolt://localhost:7687 or bolt+s://localhost:7687 or bolt+ssc://localhost:7687, depending on the local database setup

| `CONFIG_INSTANCE_n_BOLT_USERNAME`
| Bolt user name for nth instance
| neo4j

| `CONFIG_INSTANCE_n_BOLT_PASSWORD`
| Bolt password for nth instance
| password
|===

[[querylog]]
==== Query log collection configuration

[cols="<,<,<",options="header"]
|===
| Variable
| Description
| Example

| `CONFIG_INSTANCE_n_QUERY_LOG_PORT`
| Port for connecting the agent to the Neo4j log4j appender.
If not set, the query log collection feature is treated as disabled.
| 9500

| `CONFIG_INSTANCE_n_LOG_CONFIG_PATH`
| Path to the instance xref:../addition/../addition/instance-requirements.adoc#server_log_config[log4j config file].
If set, appends the appropriate log appender automatically (including the port specified above).
| /var/lib/neo4j/conf/server-logs.xml

| `CONFIG_INSTANCE_n_QUERY_LOG_MIN_DURATION`
| Minimum duration in milliseconds for a query to be logged (optional)
| 100

| `CONFIG_INSTANCE_n_QUERY_LOG_MIN_DURATION_FILTER_ERRORS`
| Enable filter for errors under the minimum duration in milliseconds (optional)
| true

| `CONFIG_INSTANCE_n_QUERY_LOG_DISABLE_OBFUSCATION`
| Disable the string literal obfuscation in queries (optional)
| true

| `CONFIG_INSTANCE_n_QUERY_LOG_INCLUDE_AGENT`
| Collect and show queries coming from the NOM agent (optional)
| true
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
Environment variable considerations:

* `n` in the above environment variables needs to be replaced with `1`, `2`, etc. for each of the monitored DBMS instances on the same host.
For example, for a single monitored DBMS, the environment variables must be named as `CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_NAME`, `CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_BOLT_URI`, `CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_BOLT_USERNAME` and `CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_BOLT_PASSWORD`.
* The instance name that you specify for `CONFIG_INSTANCE_n_NAME` will be used to identify your instance on NOM.
For this reason, it is important that you specify unique names across your cluster.
====

[NOTE]
====
Agents are supposed to monitor only local instances and should not be configured to connect to remote instances.
====

[NOTE]
====
Refer to *xref:../addition/../addition/instance-requirements.adoc[Neo4j instance requirements]* to ensure that all instances meet the requirements to be managed by NOM.
