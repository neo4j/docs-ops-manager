= Install agent

* Download platform specific binary: https://neo4j.com/download-center/#ops-manager[Download]
+
[NOTE]
==== 
In certain environments, downloading agents is not an option.
Therefore, NOM agent binaries are also bundled with Neo4j packages.
NOM agent packages can be found in the `products` folder in the Neo4j home directory. 
These binaries have support for the Neo4j version that they are bundled with.
====

* Extract the archive

* This step is only required if using *SELinux*.
To permanently change the SELinux context of the agent binary, run the following commands:
+
[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
sudo semanage fcontext -a -t bin_t <EXTRACTED_DIRECTORY_PATH>/bin/agent
sudo restorecon -v <EXTRACTED_DIRECTORY_PATH>/bin/agent
----
+
<EXTRACTED_DIRECTORY_PATH> should be replaced with the path to the extracted directory.

* Add the `bin` folder in the extracted directory to `PATH`

* To verify the installation, run the following command:
+
[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
agent version
----
+
Which should output:
+
[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
<agent name> <agent version> <agent revision>
----
