= Installation and configuration of NOM agents
:description: This section describes the installation process for a NOM agent.

== NOM Requirements for agents
NOM agents should be installed for every host in the managed estate:

* To manage a Neo4j instance, there needs to be a NOM agent running on the same host.
* To fully manage a clustered DBMS - there must be an agent for every host that hosts an instance of the DBMS.
* An agent can and should manage all instances on a single host even if they are members of different DBMSs.
