= Installation and configuration of NOM agents
:description: This section describes the installation process for a NOM agent.

NOM agents should be installed for every host in the managed estate:

* To manage a Neo4j instance, there needs to be a NOM agent running on the same host.
* To fully manage a clustered DBMS - there must be an agent for every host that hosts an instance of the DBMS.
* An agent can and should manage all instances on a single host even if they are members of different DBMSs.

[[register]]
== Register agent

Before installing an agent, it needs to be registered with the NOM server to provide server communication configuration.

. Click the top right settings icon that redirects you to the global settings.
+
image::agents-settings-icon.png[width=800]
+
. Click *Agents*, where you will see a list of all registered agents along with their last contact times and versions.
+
image::agents.png[width=800]
+
. Click *Register New Agent* button, and enter the name and description for your new agent followed by clicking *Register* button.
+

+
. The agent will be created and randomly generated agent credentials will be displayed on the screen.
+

+
[NOTE]
====
The credentials and other key agent configuration values are displayed as environment variable declarations.
You can copy them over to the host for ease of agent configuration.
====
+
. After you have captured the credentials, click the confirmation checkbox and *Finish* button.
Newly created agent will be displayed on the list of agents.



[[install]]
== Install agent

The following steps are required to install an agent:

* Standalone binaries (only linux and windows platform binaries are available)
** Download: https://neo4j.com/download-center/#ops-manager[Download]
** Extract the archive:

** Add the `bin` folder in the extracted directory to `PATH`
* To verify the installation, run the following command:
+
[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
agent version
----
+
Which should output:
+
[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
<agent name> <agent version> <agent revision>
----

* Make sure the agent version is equal to that of the NOM server.


[[configure]]
== Configure agent

An agentâ€™s run configurations are provided through environment variables.
The tables here list configuration keys and values to be set for them.

The following environment variables need to be set to allow the agent to communicate with the NOM Server.
Copy these from the `Agent Credentials` dialog in the register step.

[cols="<,<,<",options="header"]
|===
| Variable
| Description
| Example

| `CONFIG_SERVER_ADDRESS`
| Server GRPC Address
| server:9090

| `CONFIG_TOKEN_URL`
| Server Token URL
| +++https://server:8080/api/login/agent+++

| `CONFIG_TOKEN_CLIENT_ID`
| Client ID for the agent
|` 3ff98478-d6d2-4e1b-b816-e758c835f076`

| `CONFIG_TOKEN_CLIENT_SECRET`
| Client secret for the agent
| secret
|===

The following environment variables specify start configuration for the agent:
[cols="<,<,<",options="header"]
|===
| Variable
| Description
| Example
| `CONFIG_TLS_TRUSTED_CERTS`
| PEM encoded trusted CA list ()
| `/path/to/a/pem/file`

| `CONFIG_LOG_LEVEL`
| Log level (debug,info,warn,error)
| info

| `CONFIG_LOG_FILE`
| Path to the log file
| `/var/log/nom-agent/log.txt`
|===

[NOTE]
====
Since agent-server communication needs to be encrypted, you need to configure the agent so that it trusts the server's certificates.
The file that contains the trusted certificate list (PEM encoded) can be specified through the `CONFIG_TLS_TRUSTED_CERTS` environment variable.
While most operating systems default to the system-wide trusted certificates, that's not the case on Windows.
For that reason, you **must** set this environment variable on Windows.
====

For each managed DBMS instance on the host, the following environment variables need to be set to allow the agent to access the instance:

[cols="<,<,<",options="header"]
|===
| Variable
| Description
| Example

| `CONFIG_INSTANCE_n_NAME`
| Name of nth instance
| my-instance-n

| `CONFIG_INSTANCE_n_BOLT_URI`
| Bolt URI for nth instance with bolt or bolt+s protocol
| bolt://localhost:7687 or bolt+s://localhost:7687 or bolt+ssc://localhost:7687, depending on the local database setup

| `CONFIG_INSTANCE_n_BOLT_USERNAME`
| Bolt user name for nth instance
| neo4j

| `CONFIG_INSTANCE_n_BOLT_PASSWORD`
| Bolt password for nth instance
| password
|===

[[querylog]]
To enable the query log collection functionality, there are also a few additional environment variables.
If `CONFIG_INSTANCE_n_QUERY_LOG_PORT` is not set, the feature is treated as disabled. 
The rest of NOM still works.

[cols="<,<,<",options="header"]
|===
| Variable
| Description
| Example

| `CONFIG_INSTANCE_n_QUERY_LOG_PORT`
| Port for connecting the agent to the Neo4j log4j appender
| 9500

| `CONFIG_INSTANCE_n_LOG_CONFIG_PATH`
| Path to the instance log4j config. 
If set, appends the appropriate log appender automatically (including the port specified above).
| /var/lib/neo4j/conf/server-logs.xml

| `CONFIG_INSTANCE_n_QUERY_LOG_MIN_DURATION`
| Minimum duration in milliseconds for a query to be logged (optional)
| 100

| `CONFIG_INSTANCE_n_QUERY_LOG_MIN_DURATION_FILTER_ERRORS`
| Enable filter for errors under the minimum duration in milliseconds (optional)
| true

| `CONFIG_INSTANCE_n_QUERY_LOG_DISABLE_OBFUSCATION`
| Disable the string literal obfuscation in queries (optional)
| true
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
Environment variable considerations:

* `n` in the above environment variables needs to be replaced with `1`, `2`, etc. for each of the monitored DBMS instances on the same host.
For example, for a single monitored DBMS, the environment variables must be named as `CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_NAME`, `CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_BOLT_URI`, `CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_BOLT_USERNAME` and `CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_BOLT_PASSWORD`.
* The instance name that you specify for `CONFIG_INSTANCE_n_NAME` will be used to identify your instance on NOM.
For this reason, it is important that you specify unique names across your cluster.
====

[NOTE]
====
Agents are supposed to monitor only local instances and should not be configured to connect to remote instances.
====

[NOTE]
====
Refer to *xref:../addition/../addition/instance-requirements.adoc[Neo4j instance requirements]* to ensure that all instances meet the requirements to be managed by NOM.

[[running-agent]]
== Run agent

An agent can run in two modes, console or service.
Best practice is to run an agent in service mode.

. Run an agent in console mode:
+
All configuration values for the agent should be set as environment variables before starting the agent
+
* Command:
+
[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
agent console
----

. Run an agent in service mode:
+
To run an agent in service means that the agent process runs in the background and monitors the instance and this is the recommended way.
The agent lifecycle is handled by the operating system service manager.
+
* Install the service for linux (systemd):
+
** Run
+
[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
agent service install
----
** Execute
+
[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
systemctl edit neo4j-ops-manager-agent.service
----
+
and set environment variables by either setting Environment or EnvironmentFile options.
For example, using the Environment options, the override file can look as follows:
+
[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
[Service]
Environment="CONFIG_SERVER_ADDRESS=<server grpc address>"
Environment="CONFIG_TOKEN_URL=<server http login url>"
Environment="CONFIG_TOKEN_CLIENT_ID=<client id>"
Environment="CONFIG_TOKEN_CLIENT_SECRET=<client secret>"
Environment="CONFIG_TLS_TRUSTED_CERTS=</path/to/trusted/certs/pem/file>"
Environment="CONFIG_LOG_FILE=</path/to/nom-agent/log.txt>"
Environment="CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_NAME=<instance name>"
Environment="CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_BOLT_URI=<bolt uri of the local instance>"
Environment="CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_BOLT_USERNAME=<local instance user name>"
Environment="CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_BOLT_PASSWORD=<local instance password>"
Environment="CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_QUERY_LOG_PORT=<an available port>"
Environment="CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_LOG_CONFIG_PATH=/var/lib/neo4j/conf/server-logs.xml"
----
+
Please refer to the full list of options <<configure,here>>.

** Start your service
+
[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
systemctl start neo4j-ops-manager-agent.service
----
+
or
+
[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
systemctl stop neo4j-ops-manager-agent.service
----
** Logs are available, using journalctl, via
+
[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
journalctl -u neo4j-ops-manager-agent
----
+
* Install the service for Windows:
** Run
+
[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
agent service install
----
+
** Open registry editor and navigate to `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\neo4j-ops-manager-agent`.
** Create a key of type `REG_MULTI_SZ` named `Environment` and add your environment variables, each on a separate line, for example:
+
[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
CONFIG_SERVER_ADDRESS=<server grpc address>
CONFIG_TOKEN_URL=<server http login url>
CONFIG_TOKEN_CLIENT_ID=<client id>
CONFIG_TOKEN_CLIENT_SECRET=<client secret>
CONFIG_TLS_TRUSTED_CERTS=</path/to/the/trusted/certs/pem>
CONFIG_LOG_FILE=</path/to/nom-agent/log.txt>
CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_NAME=<instance name>
CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_BOLT_URI=<bolt uri of the local instance>
CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_BOLT_USERNAME=<local instance user name>
CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_BOLT_PASSWORD=<local instance password>
CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_QUERY_LOG_PORT=<an available port>
CONFIG_INSTANCE_1_LOG_CONFIG_PATH=<path to Neo4j server-logs.xml>
----
+
Please refer to the full list of options <<configure,here>>.

** Start your service
+
[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
agent service start
----
+
* To uninstall the service
+
[source, terminal, role=noheader]
----
agent service uninstall
----

== Check agent and DBMS(s)
Ensure agent has contacted NOM server, is online and is reporting DBMS(s) correctly.

. Return to Agents listing in global settings
+
image::agents.png[width=800]
. Identify the newly created agent.
. Check that there is a value for _Last contact time_.
    ** If the agent has never contacted NOM server then go back to where the agent is running and check the logs.
    It may be that the server address is configured incorrectly or the TLS certificates are not correctly specified. 
. Verify that the agent has a current status of `Online`. 
    ** If the agent is not currently online then go to where it is running and check the logs.
. Hover over the newly added agent and click the cog icon to show agent configuration. Check configuration is as expected.
. Navigate to the home page (if this agent is the first to manage an instance in a DBMS, it may take a few minutes for the DBMS to appear).
. Select the _Alerts_ tab and make sure that there are no alerts for any of the DBMSs managed by the new agent.
