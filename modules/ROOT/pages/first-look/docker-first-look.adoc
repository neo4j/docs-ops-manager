= Docker first look guide
:description: this page describes the docker compose provisioning instructions for the NOM server and NOM persistence and how to start agents on running Neo4j docker containers.


Docker compose can be used to provision a set of related containers as services to experiment with or to run in test environments.

Docker does not recommend using compose for production.

The manual installation, configuring and running of agents on the Neo4j containers is lost if the container is stopped. 

== Prerequisites
* unix-based operating system
* Docker
* Docker compose

== Prepare hosts file

You need to set up the following host names in your `/etc/hosts` or `C:/windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts file`;
[source,, role=noheader]
----
127.0.0.1   storage server db-single
----

==  Create persistence DBMS and NOM server

=== Create an empty directory for self-signed certificates

Create a directory *`~/.nom/ssc`* on your local machine before running Docker compose.
The compose file below specifies that:

* This directory will be mounted into the docker container.
* Self-signed certificates will be generated and saved to the mounted directory during the container start up.
* The generated certificates are used by the NOM server

These certificates are used by the server itself but are also required to configure the NOM agent. 

[NOTE]
====
For *`sudo`* docker compose command, make sure the correct path to *`.nom/ssc`* is set in the bind section below.
====

=== Copy docker compose file

Following is a docker compose file that can be used to start up a NOM server and Enerprise Neo4j Persistence system without any customization. 
Copy this to your local machine as `docker-compose.yaml`.

Edit the yaml as follows:

*  replace all three occurences of <PERSISTENCE_PASSWORD> with a secure password. 
*  replace all three occurences of <SSC_PASSWORD> with a secure password.

Documentation for NOM server docker image is *xref:installation/docker/container.adoc[here]*.

=== Run docker compose 
Run the follwing command:

[source, shell]
----
docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml up <folder for context, typically current folder>
----

=== Open NOM UI
Wait for the server container to start and then go to https://server:8080. 
Login as admin:passw0rd and accept license terms. 

== Set up instance and agent

=== Register agent 
In NOM UI - navigate to Agent settings (clicking on the sad robot takes you to the correct page) and add a new agent.
Copy environment variables that are provided. 

Full documentation on registering an agent is *xref:addition/index.adoc#register[here]*. 

=== Create docker compose file for Neo4j instance (pre-configured for agent)

Copy compose file below into `docker-compose.instance.yaml` and edit as follows: 

* Replace `<CONFIG_TOKEN_CLIENT_ID from register agent step>` and `<CONFIG_TOKEN_CLIENT_SECRET from register agent step>` with the values shown during the reigister agent step in the NOM UI. 
* Replace all three occurences of <NEO4J_INSTANCE_PASSWORD> with a secure password.

== Explore NOM UI
Go to NOM UI and wait for DBMS to appear - this may take a few minutes. 
You should be able to see that the agent has connected in the agents listing. 
Once the DBMS is shown in the home page, double click on the name (initially a generated string) to edit it. 
Double click on the DBMS to see the metrics, status, security panel, logs and upgrade pages for the DBMS.
