= Alerts and Conditions
:description: This section describes how to manage Alerts and Conditions in Neo4j Ops Manager.


== Alerts on the Home page

Home page alerts aggregates the alerts for your individual monitored systems.

TODO describe alert panel

TODO: example referres to another section!
The alerts generated for a cluster that has agents that have stopped reporting, as described above, is illustrated in the image below.

Location of the alert can help you understand the location of the problem, so it can be resolved faster.

== Managing Alerts

Alert details can be shown in the Alerts tab of the Alerts page of the selected DBMS.

[NOTE]
====
Only Alerts that are relevant to the selected DBMS are shown on the Alerts tab.
====

An Alert can be locally dismissed for the specified period of time.
Dismissing an Alert temporarily removes it from the Alerts table and Alerts panel in the Home view.
After the dismissal time the Alert will reappear in the Alerts table.

== Managing Conditions

Conditions defined in the scope of the selected DBMS can be managed in the Conditions tab of the Alert page of the selected DBMS.

A Condition can be *enabled* or *disabled* by turning the switch to the left of the condition on and off.
If a Condition is not enabled, it will not result in an Alert being created.

All Conditions of the selected DBMS can be *enabled* or *disabled* at once by clicking the switch located in the table header.

A Condition can be *deleted* using the "..." menu located at the end of every Condition table row.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If an event-based Condition is deleted, and that event occurs, then a default Condition will be created for that event.
Therefore, it is recommended to disable event-based Conditions instead of deleting them.
