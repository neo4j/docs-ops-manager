This section describes Notifications and Notification Channels in Neo4j Ops Manager

Notifications enable forwarding raised alerts over common Channel types to specific Channels. Setting up notifications comprises two steps:

* Channels configuration
* Notifications configuration

The notification management is performed in the *Notifications* section of the NOM settings page.

== Channels

Channel types represent the transport media while Channels represent the actual receivers.

=== Email (SMTP)

NOM allows configuring a single SMTP Outbox Server with SSL, STARTTLS or no encryption.

* To configure the outbox server click on *"Configure email"* button from the Channels section to open the creation modal. Fill in the outbox server address and port, the encryption type, the username and password, test the server connection (optional) and click on  *"Confirm"*.

[NOTE]
====
Selecting "None" security for a STARTTLS encrypted server will result in a successful connection test, but will generally fail to send an actual email for the majority of email providers.

* To remove the email configuration click on the *"x"* icon on the grey "Configured Email" tag.

=== Webhooks

NOM allows configuring multiple Webhooks and supports both custom implementations and some common providers (_Discord_, _Teams_ and _Slack_). NOM will forward an alert to a webhook via a HTTP POST request with a JSON payload. A custom webhook implementation should accept the following _Generic_ request body and return a `2XX` status to be rendered successful.

    "location": "Location"
}

* To configure a webhook click on *"Add webhook"* button from the Channels section to open the creation modal. Define a name, fill in the webhook type and URL, send a test message (optional) and click on  *"Add"*.

== Notifications

Individual Notification Configurations (Notifications) can be configured when at least one channel is setup. A notification defines what type of alerts, in which DBMSs should notify which channel.

.Example
[NOTE]
====
When an alert of type [*WARNING*, *ERROR*] is raised inside [*CS Cluster Prod*, *CS Single Prod*] notify NOM users [*nom-admin@neo4j.com*] and webhooks [*Slack#test*, *Generic#prod-errors*].
====

* To configure a notification click on *"Add notification"* button from the Notifications section to open the creation modal. Define a name, select the DBMSs and alert levels in scope, select the channels and click on  *"Confirm"*.

[NOTE]
====
Email notifications can only be sent to email addresses of NOM users.
====

image::notifications-notification-edit.png[width=800]

* To remove the notification click on *"Delete"* context menu item.
* To test the notification click on *"Test"* context menu item. This will send a test message to all configured channels.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Removing all channels that are part of a notification will result in the removal of the notification itself.
