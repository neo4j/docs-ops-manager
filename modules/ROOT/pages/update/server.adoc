[[server-version-notes]]
== Version specific notes

=== 1.5

This version introduces multi-user capabilities. 
As a result, the product analytics and crash analytics opt-out toggles have moved to a global setting accessible only by the NOM server admin.

To configure the opt-out toggles, please refer to *xref:../installation/server.adoc#config_ref[Server configuration reference]*

=== 1.4

The initial startup of 1.4 after update may take longer than usual, especially if the persistence store contains a large amount of query log data.

This is due to additions to the query log model which require existing data to be migrated.

=== 1.3
[IMPORTANT]
====

All metrics will be deleted as part of the migration that runs on update to version 1.3.

This is due to a major change to the metric storage model making previous metrics incompatible with this version.
